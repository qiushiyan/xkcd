This package is a wrapper around the javascript [chart.xkcd](https://github.com/timqian/chart.xkcd) library to create xkcd-styled chart for R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of xkcd like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("qiushiyan/xkcd")
```

Inspired by [`echarts4r`](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/), a plot is created first by initialization of `x_chart`, which is appended by functions such as `x_line`, `x_point` and `x_bar` specifying chart type. For example, a line graph of yearly average life expectancy from the `gapminder` dataset is created as follows

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(xkcd)
library(dplyr)

df <- gapminder::gapminder |>
  filter(country %in% c("United States", "United Kingdom", "Canada", "Australia"))

df |>
  x_chart(title = "my xkcd line graph") |>
  x_line(x = "year", y = "lifeExp", color = "country") |>
  x_options(legend_position = 4)
```
